1. A node module is a resuable bit of code that accomplishes a task for us....They are meant to help code stay organized, and need to be included into the main file.

2. module.exports refers to the specific object type..and the exports method on  the module...exports isnt as specific and refers to the module.exports

3. because it helps with naming...and keeps us from overriding the module.exports with an assignment operator.
